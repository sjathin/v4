Speeding and drunken drive are the basic reasons for vehicle accident. Many lives could have been saved if emergency service could get accident information and reach in time and if drunken drivers are prevented from driving. Nowadays, GPS has become an integral part of a vehicle system. This paper proposes to utilize the capability of a GPS to send accident location to an Alert Service Center. The accelerometer will monitor speed of a vehicle and measure the impact of collision. Whenever the speed will be below the specified speed, it will assume that an accident has occurred. The system will then send the accident location acquired from the GPS along with the time and the speed by utilizing the GSM network. Also in this paper we check whether the person is drunken or not by using the MQ3 GAS sensor. In this system , sensor circuit is used to detect whether the alcohol was consumed by driver or not. When alcohol concentration is detected then vehicleâ€™s information will go to traffic police through GSM and thus preventing accidents. This will help the rescue service to reach in time and save the valuable human life. This paper is based on EMBEDDED C programming using Arduino mega.
