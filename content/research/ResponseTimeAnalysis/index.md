Explored response time analysis of real-time systems on multi-core processors using Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) task models. Developed an algorithm that improves accuracy by controlling subtask execution order and modeling sporadic tasks more effectively. Demonstrated reduced pessimism and better performance compared to existing methods through experimental validation.
